# Non-stop-Rickroll
Use this bash script to non-stop Rickroll! There is no way to exit out of the script as it traps all Keyboard Interrupts that stop script/program (such as, but not limited to, Ctrl + C or Ctrl + Z). Ctrl + S and Ctrl + Q still work.

# Setup
Simply install the bash script and run it!

Make it your own command by renaming it to *command_name* (no extension) and add the file to /bin
